# üõçÔ∏è Churn Analysis Using Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce 

## Problem Statement
In the e-commerce sector, customer churn represents a critical challenge that can significantly impact business sustainability and profitability. Understanding the factors leading to customer churn is essential for developing effective retention strategies. This project aims to analyze an e-commerce dataset to identify patterns and characteristics associated with customer churn, and to develop segmentation models that can help target at-risk customers and optimize marketing efforts.

**Dataset**: Ecommerce Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction [[source]](https://www.kaggle.com/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction)

## Goals 
**Reduce Customer Churn:** by identifing and targeting high-risk customers to improve retention and increase customer lifetime value, leading to enhanced revenue stability.

**Optimize Marketing Spend:** Use segmentation insights to allocate marketing resources more effectively, boosting ROI and driving higher engagement and conversions.


## Libraries Used
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Plotting and visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms and preprocessing.

## Project Outline
### 3.1 Data Collection and Preparation
- **Data Collection**: Obtain the e-commerce dataset containing customer attributes, transaction details, and churn status.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies using appropriate imputation methods.
- **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant features and remove redundant columns.

### 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Visualization
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Compute summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Use correlation tests to explore relationships between variables.
- **Visualizations**: Create plots to visualize data distributions and relationships (e.g., histograms, count plots).

### 3.3 Customer Segmentation
- **RFM Segmentation**: Segmenting done by Recency, frequency, and monetary value of transactions per customer  
- **K-Means**: Dividing customers into clusters based on their behavioral data.

### 3.4 Business Insights and Recommendations

## EDA Insights
* This dataset has 5630 observations and 20 variables with 15 numerical variables, 5 categorical variables and 2 target variable.
* From the data visualization, it is obtained that the churn ratio has a correlation with tenure, complaints, cashback Amount, & preferred order cat.
* Male customers (10.7%) churn more on e-commerce than female customers (6.2%). The assumption is because male users will churn after finding the item they are looking for.
* Customers who churn more have a Satisfaction Score of 3 (5.1%). However, there are also those who have a customer satisfaction score of 5 but still churn, at 4.7%. This shows that customer satisfaction does not affect customers to churn.
* Customers who file more complaints (9.0%) have a greater potential to churn than those who do not file complaints (7.8%). This is possible because customers who file complaints feel dissatisfied with the existing service.
* Customers who are still single tend to churn by 8.2%. The assumption is that because they are still single, so they don't buy many necessities.
* Customers who churn more choose to buy mobile phones by 9.6%. The assumption is because of the need to buy mobile phones every year. Even so, mobile phone purchases tend to be one-time or one-time purchases so there is no need for a second and third purchase at relatively the same time.
* Customers who churn by 11% tend to log in using a mobile phone rather than a computer. This can be made into a strategy to retain customers by providing discount coupons if they log in using a mobile phone.
* It can be concluded that customers who tend to churn are male, satisfaction score 3, more complaints, more purchases of mobile phones and login using mobile phones.
